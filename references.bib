	abstract = {Time synchronization and localization are basic services in a sensor network system. Although they often depend on each other, they are usually tackled independently. In this work, we investigate the time synchronization and localization problems in underwater sensor networks, where more challenges are introduced because of the unique characteristics of the water environment. These challenges include long propagation delay and transmission delay, low bandwidth, energy constraint, mobility, etc. We propose a joint solution for localization and time synchronization, in which the stratification effect of underwater medium is considered, so that the bias in the range estimates caused by assuming sound waves travel in straight lines in water environments is compensated. By combining time synchronization and localization, the accuracy of both are improved jointly. Additionally, an advanced tracking algorithm interactive multiple model (IMM) is adopted to improve the accuracy of localization in the mobile case. Furthermore, by combining both services, the number of required exchanged messages is significantly reduced, which saves on energy consumption. Simulation results show that both services are improved and benefit from this scheme.},

Efficient use of the limited energy resources of wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes is critically important to support these advances, and application of topology control methods will have a profound impact on energy efficiency and hence battery lifetime. In this survey, we focus on the energy efficiency issue and present a comprehensive study of topology control techniques for extending the lifetime of battery powered WSNs. First, we review the significant topology control algorithms to provide insights into how energy efficiency is achieved by design. Further, these algorithms are classified according to the energy conservation approach they adopt, and evaluated by the trade-offs they offer to aid designers in selecting a technique that best suits their applications. Since the concept of "network lifetime" is widely used for assessing the algorithms' performance, we highlight various definitions of the term and discuss their merits and drawbacks. Recently, there has been growing interest in algorithms for non-planar topologies such as deployments in underwater environments or multi-level buildings. For this reason, we also include a detailed discussion of topology control algorithms that work efficiently in three dimensions. Based on the outcomes of our review, we identify a number of open research issues for achieving energy efficiency through topology control.},

	abstract = {Driverless cars and driver-assisted vehicles are becoming prevalent in today's transportation systems. Companies like TESLA, Audi, and Google are among the leaders in this new era of the automotive industry. Modern vehicles, equipped with sophisticated navigation devices, complex driver-assisted systems, and a whole lot of safety features, bring broader impacts to our quality of life, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Instant safety messages such as pre-collision warnings, blind-spot detection, pedestrian and object awareness significantly improve the safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. As a result, vehicles would be able to travel closely yet safely together, forming a platoon, thus resulting in a reduction of traffic congestion and fuel consumption. Driverless cars also have non-safety-related applications: which are used to facilitate traffic management and infotainment dissemination for drivers and passengers. Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET), the wireless communication technology enabling driverless cars, features not only dynamic topology but also high mobility. The vehicle nodes move rapidly on streets and highways. Their movements also depend on but not limited to road traffic, speed limits, and behavior of nearby vehicles. With massive amount of messages exchanged among driverless cars that command the cars' movements at high speeds and in close distances, any malicious alternation could lead to disastrous accidents. Message authentication to ensure data integrity is paramount to attack preparation. This paper presents a novel message authentication scheme that protects cars from bogus messages and makes VANET resilient to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The work includes a simulation framework that integrates vehicle and data traffic models to validate the effectiveness of the proposed message authentication scheme.},

	abstract = {Underwater communication systems have drawn the attention of the research community in the last 15 years. This growing interest can largely be attributed to new civil and military applications enabled by large-scale networks of underwater devices (e.g., underwater static sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles (AUVs), and autonomous robots), which can retrieve information from the aquatic and marine environment, perform in-network processing on the extracted data, and transmit the collected information to remote locations. Currently underwater communication systems are inherently hardware-based and rely on closed and inflexible architectural design. This imposes significant challenges into adopting new underwater communication and networking technologies, prevent the provision of truly-differentiated services to highly diverse underwater applications, and induce great barriers to integrate heterogeneous underwater devices. Software-defined networking (SDN), recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm, relies on the highly flexible, programmable, and virtualizable network architecture to dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution. In this paper, a software-defined architecture, namely SoftWater, is first introduced to facilitate the development of the next-generation underwater communication systems. More specifically, by exploiting the network function virtualization (NFV) and network virtualization concepts, SoftWater architecture can easily incorporate new underwater communication solutions, accordingly maximize the network capacity, can achieve the network robustness and energy efficiency, as well as can provide truly differentiated and scalable networking services. Consequently, the SoftWater architecture can simultaneously support a variety of different underwater applications, and can enable the interoperability of underwater devices from different manufacturers that operate on different underwater communication technologies based on acoustic, optical, or radio waves. Moreover, the essential network management tools of SoftWater are discussed, including reconfigurable multi-controller placement, hybrid in-band and out-of-band control traffic balancing, and utility-optimal network virtualization. Furthermore, the major benefits of SoftWater architecture are demonstrated by introducing software-defined underwater networking solutions, including the throughput-optimal underwater routing, SDN-enhanced fault recovery, and software-defined underwater mobility management. The research challenges to realize the SoftWater are also discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), if sensors rely on multi-hop transmission to send sensing data to the sink above the water, sensors that are closer to the water's surface will deplete energy sooner because they share a larger load of the packet relaying work. This problem becomes worse if the water being monitored is very deep. This imbalance in energy consumption can be effectively mitigated by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data. However, if the data to collect are important, the delay time required by this data gathering method may be too long. In this study, we integrate the two data gathering mechanisms mentioned above, namely utilization of AUVs and multi-hop transmission, to reduce the problem of unbalanced energy consumption and long delay time. Moreover, we also investigate how to determine the importance level of data and set delay time requirements without domain knowledge. Our purpose is to deliver data of higher importance to the sink within the delay time requirement. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance in energy consumption, reduce the delay time required for delivering important data, and also prolong the network lifetime.},

There is a light introduction which draws similarities and differences between UWSNs and terrestrial sensor networks, explains challenges unique to UWSNs, and clearly states the problem that is being solved by their contributions. The next section describes the operation of VBF as an overview which includes the contents of each packet, and the methods of routing initiation by query packets. The subsequent section proposes an algorithm that uses self-adaptation to save energy in a dense network. A mathematical model for node desirability with respect to the routing vector is defined and used in the explanation of the self-adaptation algorithm.
The remainder of the paper evaluates the performance of VBF in terms of success rate, energy consumption, and average delay, under scenarios which vary node mobility speed and number of nodes in the network. The results show that "in VBF, node speed has little impact" on the three metrics quantified for this evaluation, and "[the experiment] demonstrates that VBF could handle node mobility very effectively." There is another technical report by the authors which gives results of simulations showing the impact of more specific aspects of the protocol, given in the paper as [8]. The conclusion remarks on reasons that cause VBF to stand out amongst other geographic routing protocols, namely that it does not need the exact positioning of nodes to be available. Two of the authors are from the University of Connecticut, an institution which is highly active in the field of UWSNs, and the other from University of California, Los Angeles. The authors have made several invaluable contributions to UWSNs as well as computer networks in general.},

	abstract = {Efficient multimedia and specifically image authentication is critical and in demand to protect data vulnerability in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN). This is to prevent malicious intruders from modifying and forging image contents over a network. Watermarking technique has been widely used to assert an image data authentication over wired networks; however, resource constraints (e.g. processing power, communication energy) in small sensors and the state of error-prone wireless channels result in fundamental challenges for developing efficient watermarking schemes in WMSN. These challenges include how to embed/protect/extract watermark efficiently and robustly in low-cost sensors and how to transmit authenticated image and multimedia with high energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a communication-resource-aware and adaptive watermarking scheme for multimedia authentication in WMSN. Our contribution is two folds. First, the transmission quality for the watermark as well as watermarked multimedia authenticity by embedding watermark with adaptive coding redundancies, and by unequally allocating network resources to protect the image and multimedia packets with the watermark information. Second, communication energy efficiency and real time performance are achieved with the watermark being adaptive to the network condition and the processing delay reduced due to the exploited inter-frame correlation. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive watermarking system can achieve considerable gains in terms of energy saving, image transmission quality and multimedia authentication performance.},

	abstract = {Underwater acoustic communications have found applications in many fields with great developments. Thus, the demand for security of such communications is rapidly growing. Two parties in the communication, after authentication, generally use a secure symmetric key to encrypt all the data they transmit. Thus, an efficient key generation algorithm is in urgent need to guarding the privacy of the communication data. This paper presents a novel key generation system which is easy to be implemented, efficient in computation and communication, and robust to the spatio-temporal variable ocean environments. Unlike those conventional solutions, by exploiting reciprocity, deep fades, randomness extractor and robust secure fuzzy information reconciliators, which is first introduced by us in this paper, channel characteristics are used to generate the key in our solution.},
