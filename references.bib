	abstract = {Underwater communication systems have drawn the attention of the research community in the last 15 years. This growing interest can largely be attributed to new civil and military applications enabled by large-scale networks of underwater devices (e.g., underwater static sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles (AUVs), and autonomous robots), which can retrieve information from the aquatic and marine environment, perform in-network processing on the extracted data, and transmit the collected information to remote locations. Currently underwater communication systems are inherently hardware-based and rely on closed and inflexible architectural design. This imposes significant challenges into adopting new underwater communication and networking technologies, prevent the provision of truly-differentiated services to highly diverse underwater applications, and induce great barriers to integrate heterogeneous underwater devices. Software-defined networking (SDN), recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm, relies on the highly flexible, programmable, and virtualizable network architecture to dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution. In this paper, a software-defined architecture, namely SoftWater, is first introduced to facilitate the development of the next-generation underwater communication systems. More specifically, by exploiting the network function virtualization (NFV) and network virtualization concepts, SoftWater architecture can easily incorporate new underwater communication solutions, accordingly maximize the network capacity, can achieve the network robustness and energy efficiency, as well as can provide truly differentiated and scalable networking services. Consequently, the SoftWater architecture can simultaneously support a variety of different underwater applications, and can enable the interoperability of underwater devices from different manufacturers that operate on different underwater communication technologies based on acoustic, optical, or radio waves. Moreover, the essential network management tools of SoftWater are discussed, including reconfigurable multi-controller placement, hybrid in-band and out-of-band control traffic balancing, and utility-optimal network virtualization. Furthermore, the major benefits of SoftWater architecture are demonstrated by introducing software-defined underwater networking solutions, including the throughput-optimal underwater routing, SDN-enhanced fault recovery, and software-defined underwater mobility management. The research challenges to realize the SoftWater are also discussed in detail.},

Software-defined networking (SDN) is then introduced as the "next-generation networking paradigm." A SDN underwater communication architecture called SoftWater is proposed, and it is explained in detail why it will be a major improvement upon the current state of underwater networking. Several important features are covered, including adaptivity, infrastructure-as-a-service, optimal throughput, convergence of heterogeneous networks, and high energy efficiency. The authors draw differences between their networking scheme and the recently introduced software-defined acoustic modems, noting that they "lack the capability to enable the programmable network layer functions," however the adaptability of the SoftWater architecture allows for them to be integrated into it's programmable data plane. The design of the architecture is covered thoroughly, as well as it's management tools. The final section proposes a full networking solution using SoftWater, and explains why it is superior to any scheme available to date. Research challenges are then summarized. The authors all have Ph. D. Degrees, and have written several relavent papers; many of which are used as self-references.},

	abstract = {In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), if sensors rely on multi-hop transmission to send sensing data to the sink above the water, sensors that are closer to the water's surface will deplete energy sooner because they share a larger load of the packet relaying work. This problem becomes worse if the water being monitored is very deep. This imbalance in energy consumption can be effectively mitigated by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data. However, if the data to collect are important, the delay time required by this data gathering method may be too long. In this study, we integrate the two data gathering mechanisms mentioned above, namely utilization of AUVs and multi-hop transmission, to reduce the problem of unbalanced energy consumption and long delay time. Moreover, we also investigate how to determine the importance level of data and set delay time requirements without domain knowledge. Our purpose is to deliver data of higher importance to the sink within the delay time requirement. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance in energy consumption, reduce the delay time required for delivering important data, and also prolong the network lifetime.},

Not much information is presented on the transport layer, besides that UDP has a lower processing delay. Topology control problem of wireless networks is suggested as a research topic. Application layer issues are presented as a very hot topic for current research, especially when combining UWSNs with other new topics such as internet of things, big data, and software defined networks.

	annote = {This is the specification for the vector-based forwarding (VBF) routing protocol which is now widely accepted as a standard for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN). There is a light introduction which draws similarities and differences between UWSNs and terrestrial sensor networks, explains challenges unique to UWSNs, and clearly states the problem that is being solved by their contributions. The next section describes the operation of VBF as an overview which includes the contents of each packet, and the methods of routing initiation by query packets. The subsequent section proposes an algorithm that uses self-adaptation to save energy in a dense network. A mathematical model for node desirability with respect to the routing vector is defined and used in the explanation of the self-adaptation algorithm.
The remainder of the paper evaluates the performance of VBF in terms of success rate, energy consumption, and average delay, under scenarios which vary node mobility speed and number of nodes in the network. The results show that "in VBF, node speed has little impact" on the three metrics quantified for this evaluation, and "[the experiment] demonstrates that VBF could handle node mobility very effectively." There is another technical report by the authors which gives results of simulations showing the impact of more specific aspects of the protocol, given in the paper as [8]. The conclusion remarks on reasons that cause VBF to stand out amongst other geographic routing protocols, namely that it does not need the exact positioning of nodes to be available. Two of the authors are from the University of Connecticut, an institution which is highly active in the field of UWSNs, and the other from University of California, Los Angeles. The authors have made several invaluable contributions to UWSNs as well as computer networks in general.},

Applications of UWSNs range from oceanographic data collection to disaster prevention. UWSNs are vulnerable to attacks and because of their idiosyncrasies, security solutions for ground WSNs might not be applicable underwater. As a result, there is a need for mechanisms exclusively tailored to underwater environments. In this work we address the problem of authentication in UWSNs. We evaluate energy costs for different digital signature schemes for end-to-end authentication and discuss the tradeoffs involved in a number of scenarios. Our results show that schemes that perform well in ground WSN do not necessarily do well in UWSNs; and shed light on characteristics of a digital signature scheme that make them particularly suited to underwater networks.},

This article presents a secure routing design for underwater acoustic networks. First, considering the difficulty of setting a trusted third party in underwater acoustic networks, a short signature algorithm without any online trusted third party is proposed and is used in the procedure of route setup for authentication between source and destination node pair. Analysis shows that the proposed signature scheme can resist forgery attacks effectively and improve communication security and signature efficiency. Second, a trap-door scheme in routing messages based on bilinear map is presented, which achieves anonymity of communication nodes to forwarding nodes. Finally, the anonymity of intermediate nodes in the routing path is also realized by encoding their session ID. Simulation results show the secure routing scheme has moderate network performance under the premise of secure communication.},

In analysis, IBC is found to exchange far less bits than PKC, leading to a low-bandwidth solution. The article then looks into a comparison of NIKE with symmetric key-based key-management systems (KMS). Symmetric KMS is found to have multiple security flaws, which are backed up with examples of how adversaries may be able to breach the authenticity of communication.}

It is drawn that there is no fully accepted security protocol for underwater acoustic networks. Requirements for a more secure underwater network are described in great detail, with explanations of what each concept is, why it is relavant, and what it entails. The remainder of the article describes a network architecture with unique security features at each layer, all of which consider the characteristics of underwater communication. It is evaluated using metrics of fault-tolerance, overhead, and security.},
